This file serves as an operational and technical guide for all AI agents and developers working on the frontend components of the gdp-fertility-viz project. The frontend directory is focused on implementing an interactive D3.js scatter plot with additional functionality such as a time slider and country selection dropdown. Developers should adhere to a modular approach in which each component – such as the visualization logic, data interactions via axios, and DOM manipulations – is encapsulated in separate functions within app.js. Use descriptive variable names and include inline comments to clarify logic for filtering, zooming, and transitioning between data states. In addition to the D3 library, ensure you are utilizing axios appropriately to fetch any additional data if needed from the backend endpoints. It is critical to follow established coding practices and to keep the code as simple and maintainable as possible, while also integrating unit tests where feasible in the tests folder. When implementing the time slider, pay close attention to event handling and performance implications due to rapid update cycles. The HTML file (index.html) should include proper semantic markup and links to external style and script assets. Furthermore, implement responsive design practices in styles.css so that the visualization adjusts gracefully across different devices and screen sizes. This guide also emphasizes the importance of incremental commits using a clear and descriptive commit message style. Merge regularly to avoid late conflicts and ensure that feature branches are kept up-to-date with the master branch. This detailed guidance should help AI agents harmoniously work on the frontend, ensuring that visual interactivity and user experience are not compromised in pursuit of technical excellence. Additional testing guidelines, coding conventions, and file organization rules can be found in the central development standards document. Always consult this CLAUDE.md file before making major changes to ensure consistency and alignment with project goals.
