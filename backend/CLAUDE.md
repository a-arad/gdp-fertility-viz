This CLAUDE.md file targets the backend environment of the gdp-fertility-viz project and provides comprehensive guidance for AI agents and developers working on implementing the Flask-based data fetching logic. The backend is the core component that interacts with the World Bank API using the wbgapi library and manages data requests to supply the frontend with up-to-date GDP and fertility data. Developers are expected to structure the code in a modular fashion. The main entry point is app.py, which should set up the Flask application, configure CORS using flask-cors, and define well-documented API endpoints. These endpoints need to handle both GET and, if required, POST requests with clear error handling and logging mechanisms. The responsibilities are split further into data_fetcher.py, which abstracts the process of fetching and formatting data from the World Bank API. When writing functions in this file, adhere to the single responsibility principle; each function should perform a clearly defined task, such as data retrieval, transformation, or cache management if implemented. Make sure to include sufficient comments and adhere strictly to Python’s PEP8 style guidelines. The requirements.txt file must be maintained with exact versions of libraries to ensure consistency across development and deployment environments, particularly since the project is deployed on Vercel. Security considerations should also be noted: validate all incoming data requests and ensure that sensitive information such as API keys (if any) are managed securely. IT is crucial to integrate unit tests (found in the tests/ directory) specifically targeting backend functionalities to catch any disruptions in the data fetching process early. Utilize virtual environments to manage dependencies and document potential environment-specific considerations within the code comments. In addition to code, this file encourages a proactive approach for collaborative work. Prioritize regular code reviews and incremental commits using a descriptive commit style. This guidance documents the expectations regarding modularity, maintainability, and testing, thereby ensuring that the backend remains robust and ready for integration with the frontend visualization layer. Follow these detailed instructions to maintain high standards in code quality and to contribute effectively to the project’s long-term maintainability.
